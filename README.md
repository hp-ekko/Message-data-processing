# Message-data-processing
Processing message data in python
Use python to process received satellite receiver message data
This project gives me a better understanding of the basics of Python, including list
, str, dic, def, class, etc.
A total of 7 types of message data were analyze
And did the server and client, showing the data transfer process and the parsing process
The parsed data will be used for various processing later.
